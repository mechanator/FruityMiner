THIS IS FOR THE OLDER UPLEXA ALGORITHM, NOT UPLEXA2 AFTER THE FORK OF 4/29/2019 THIS VERSION WILL NOT WORK 
FOR MINING UPLEXA.
Sorry, will update when I get the new source from upsrtream.

Nvidia and AMD miner for uPlexa (UPX) algo, might work with other algorithms.


This version in releases was compiled with Visual Studio 2017 for Windows 10 X64.
Supports NVIDIA FERMI CUDA 8 Only cards due to their old architecture.
Such as the GTX 400 and 500 Series (580 and 590s rock!) The Tesla M2050/2070 series and older Quadro series that use the GF100 GF110 chipset.
Basically I followed the same instructions similar to retro building XMR-STAK.
It's already built, just get it in the release section.

Here's how to get it to work, use only with CUDA 8 cards on the rig. Mixing other cards will require a higher level driver and the miner app will not likely recognize them.
Use NVIDIA driver 391.35 or lower. You can get archived versions on GURU3D.com
Optionally install the CUDA toolkit 8.0 if you plan on compiling this.
download release, config your wallet and pool and run.
Similar performance and better than XMR-STAK in some combinations.
Enjoy.
Donations glady accepted.
